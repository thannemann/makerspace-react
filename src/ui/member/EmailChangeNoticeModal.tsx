// PR #75, email changes no longer automatically trigger Slack/Google Drive
// invites (this was being abused to generate repeat invites by repeatedly
// changing email). That means a member who legitimately changes their email
// now needs a board member to manually re-invite them under the new
// address — this modal makes that follow-up step explicit rather than
// leaving it to be silently forgotten.
